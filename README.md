photoroboto
===========

Photoroboto is a java-based photobooth application.  I created this when I started a small photobooth company after seeing how fun everyone had with the one I built for my wedding.

This code is more then 7 years old and has not been used for quite some time.  I decided to put it up here in hopes that someone can benefit from it.

It talks to a Canon SLR through the Canon SDK and applies logos and graphics to the photos once taken and then prints them to a high speed dye sublimation printer.
